      # Maven command-line options:
      # --batch-mode : recommended in CI to inform maven to not run in interactive mode (less logs)
      # -V : strongly recommended in CI, will display the JDK and Maven versions in use.
      #      Very useful to be quickly sure the selected versions were the ones you think.
      # -Dsurefire.useFile=false : useful in CI. Displays test errors in the logs directly (instead of
      #                            having to crawl the workspace files to see the cause).
      # -e : Display stack-traces on failure
